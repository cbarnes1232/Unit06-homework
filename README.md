# Unit 6 Homework 

In this project I made a web page so that when you want to look at a specific city you can multiple things.
1. You can view the City and Date on one line.
2. It gives you tempature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index.
3. Along with viewing weather related things I have given you a five day forecast.

When you enter the city it is saved on the page and you can clear the history.
